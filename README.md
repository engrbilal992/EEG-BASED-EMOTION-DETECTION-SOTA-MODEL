# EEG-BASED-EMOTION-DETECTION-SOTA-MODEL
This work presents an EEG-based emotion recognition model using DREAMERs dataset. EEG signals were segmented, denoised with an IIR filter, and 5 bands extracted. Features were selected via CHI2, and ADASYN handled class imbalance. Fine KNN achieved 92.5% accuracy in classifying sadness, joy, anger, and pleasure.
